# 17 — Garrison Zone-Clear Scoping (AABB-gated SecureCompound plans)

**Core fix shipped** (`2b31af4`). Fixes a `SecureCompoundGoal` plan-synthesis
bug where a squad tasked to secure/hold a compound charges across the entire
map instead of defending it, then sketches the richer garrison behavior it
unlocks.

## What shipped (`2b31af4`)

The AABB size+containment gate landed as a **filter on the BFS-path plan**:
`synthesizeSecurePlan` now emits a transit `EnterZone` for every route zone
but only adds a `ClearZone` for zones that pass `isGarrisonZone` (size gate:
`cellCount ≤ 1.25 × bbox area`; containment gate: `≥50%` of cells inside the
node bbox). The outdoor flood fails the size gate via an O(1) field read, so
`ClearZone[outdoor]` is gone and `HoldZone` is reachable. Covered by
`SecureCompoundGoalTest` (transit-not-clear, clear-then-hold, in-zone).

**Deferred** (folded into the GarrisonCompound follow-on below): the richer
"plan reshape" that enumerates the compound's *own* zones directly to also
clear *off-path* rooms. The current fix clears only garrison zones that lie on
the BFS route to the anchor — a multi-room compound whose side rooms branch
off the path won't get those rooms cleared. Not required to kill the observed
"charge the map" bug; the natural home for it is the patrol-the-sub-zones
GarrisonCompound goal, which needs the full `garrisonZones` set anyway.

The two follow-ups below (assault-side `CLEAR_ZONE[0]` mirror, too-strict
`HOLD_NODE` gate) remain **open** — not addressed by this commit.

## The bug (observed)

A CONQUEST reinforcement squad (SQ-87 in the captured dump) was assigned
`SECURE_COMPOUND → ARMORY → targetZone 36`, goal `SecureCompound`, but its
plan was:

```
0  EnterZone[0]
1  ClearZone[0]   ← stuck here forever
2  EnterZone[29]
3  ClearZone[29]
4  EnterZone[36]
5  ClearZone[36]
6  HoldZone[36]    ← the "defend the compound" step it never reaches
```

`SecureCompoundGoal.synthesizeSecurePlan()` runs a zone-graph BFS from the
squad's zone to the compound zone and emits an `EnterZone` + `ClearZone`
pair for **every zone on the path** (`SecureCompoundGoal.java:106-127`).
The path ran through **zone 0 — the entire outdoor flood-fill** (one zone
covers the whole exterior; see `memory/flat_edges_between_kinds.md`).

`ClearZone[0]` only reports SUCCESS when `ZoneQueries.zoneClear(0, DEFENDER)`
is true — i.e. *no living defender stands anywhere outdoors*
(`ZoneQueries.java:106`). The dump's `clearZoneReachability` listed ~150
defenders scattered map-wide, all in zone 0, all reachable. So the squad
parks on step 1 and chases outdoor defenders across the whole map, never
advancing to `HoldZone[36]`. The Story-K "don't chase across portals" guard
(`ClearZone.java:108`) is inert here — there are no portals to cross *within*
the outdoors, so every outdoor enemy is a legal in-zone pursuit target.

## Root cause

The plan treats every zone on the route as a clearable room. That's correct
for a tight indoor sweep but catastrophic for the open exterior zone, which
is unbounded. There is no notion of "is this zone part of the compound I'm
supposed to secure, or just open ground I'm crossing?"

## Fix: AABB-gated clear scoping

`TacticalNode` already carries the compound's box (`left, top, right, bottom`,
`anchorX/Y`, `centerX/Y()` — `TacticalNode.java:116-163`). `NavigationZone`
gives `getCellCount()` (O(1)) and `getCellIndices()` (cell = `y*width + x` —
`NavigationZone.java:31-32`). That's enough to decide, per zone, whether a
`ClearZone` belongs in the plan. Two gates, cheap one first:

**1. Size gate (O(1)) — "is this zone meaningfully larger than the garrison area?"**
```
compoundArea = (right-left+1) * (bottom-top+1)
if zone.getCellCount() > K * compoundArea  →  transit only, no ClearZone
```
`getCellCount()` is a field read, so this rejects zone 0 instantly without
ever iterating its thousands of cells. K ≈ 1.25 absorbs door/edge cells that
spill just outside the box.

**2. AABB containment (O(cells), only on zones that survive gate 1).**
```
inside = count of zone cells where left ≤ x ≤ right && top ≤ y ≤ bottom
if inside / cellCount ≥ T  →  ClearZone is legitimate   (T ≈ 0.5)
else                       →  transit only
```
The size gate guarantees the per-cell loop only ever runs on small zones,
never the outdoor flood. Point-in-rect per cell is the AABB test.

This composes the two competing requirements:

- **Compound made of multiple zones** (interior rooms): each room sits inside
  the building box and is small → all clear. This is the *desired* behavior —
  a multi-room compound should clear each room.
- **Outdoor flood**: fails the size gate → transit-only `EnterZone`.

### Plan reshape (not just a filter)

Today's plan clears only zones that happen to lie on the BFS path to the
anchor — a multi-room compound never gets its off-path rooms cleared. The
AABB gate lets us enumerate the compound's *own* zones directly instead:

```
garrisonZones = zones where cellCount ≤ K*area AND insideFraction ≥ T
plan = EnterZone(toward compound)
       for each garrisonZone: ClearZone
       HoldZone(anchor)
```

Transit zones (including the outdoor crossing) get a bare `EnterZone` to move
through; only the compound's constituent rooms get `ClearZone`.

### Tuning knob: garrison area vs building box

`TacticalNode` stores only the *building* bbox. The perimeter wall / parade
ground — where `CompoundGarrisonSystem` actually drops the troops
(`CompoundGarrisonSystem.java:107-126`) — sits outside it. If the courtyard
should be cleared/held too, expand the AABB by a margin; if only the interior
matters, the raw box is fine. The margin is the main knob.

## Follow-ups surfaced by this work

- **Assault-side mirror of the same bug.** `ConquestCommand`'s Pass 2
  `nearestDefenderZoneInStrip` can hand a squad `CLEAR_ZONE[0]` whenever the
  outdoor zone has a defender in its strip (`ConquestCommand.java:363-389`)
  → `ClearAssignedZoneGoal` charges the whole map the same way. The AABB gate
  doesn't apply (no compound box); this path wants a separate "never enqueue a
  full clear against the open exterior zone" guard. Same hazard sits in
  `AssaultCommand`'s sector sweep.
- **Garrison never actually holds (HOLD_NODE gate too strict).**
  `ConquestCommand` Pass 0 assigns `HOLD_NODE` only when the squad centroid is
  *inside the compound's zone* (`ConquestCommand.java:142-157`), but garrison
  troops land on the outdoor parade ground (zone 0 ≠ building zone). So a fresh
  garrison fails the gate, falls through to Pass 1, and picks up
  `SECURE_COMPOUND` instead. Relax the gate (squad in the compound zone *or*
  within N cells of the anchor / inside the perimeter AABB), or have
  `CompoundGarrisonSystem` stamp `HOLD_NODE` at spawn rather than waiting for
  the commander to detect it by zone. This is *why* a garrison squad was
  running a charge objective at all.

## Richer follow-on: GarrisonCompound goal

The AABB gate gives a clean `garrisonZones` set. A dedicated garrison behavior
can cycle that set instead of holding one anchor: patrol the compound's
sub-zones, re-`ClearZone` on counter-attack, fall back to `HoldZone` when
clear. This is the "intelligent garrison that patrols a segmented area and
clears the encapsulated rooms" shape — sits on top of this story's scoping
primitive. Reuses the existing garrison vocabulary (`GuardPost` / `HoldPost`,
`GarrisonCordon`, `RoutinePatrol`).

## Observable behavior (after fix)

- A squad assigned `SECURE_COMPOUND` walks across the exterior to the
  compound (transit `EnterZone`, no map-wide clear), clears the building's
  rooms, then holds.
- Debug dump: plan has no `ClearZone[<outdoor zone>]` step; `HoldZone` is
  reachable.
