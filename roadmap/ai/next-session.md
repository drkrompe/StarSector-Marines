# AI — Next Session

## Where we are

Stage 2 tactical stories are mostly shipped (Slices 1–3.5 + partial
Slice 6). All three marine-side commanders now ship: `SabotageCommand`
(objective-cluster), `ConquestCommand` (lateral-strip), and
`AssaultCommand` (sector-grid sweep). Mech GOAP Stage 1 is complete
(two roles, morale, break-contact).

`AssaultCommand` just shipped (2026-05-27). Sector-grid partition with
non-sticky assignment, implicit convergence via load-balancing.

## Immediate next

0. **Garrison zone-clear scoping** (`stories/17-garrison-zone-clear-scoping.md`)
   — `SecureCompoundGoal` plans emit `ClearZone[0]` against the whole-map
   outdoor zone, so secure/garrison squads charge the map instead of holding
   the compound. Fix is an AABB size+containment gate on which zones get a
   `ClearZone` step (design complete in the story). Surgical; small scope.
   Also logs two follow-ups: assault-side `CLEAR_ZONE[0]` mirror bug, and the
   too-strict `HOLD_NODE` gate that mis-routes garrisons into `SECURE_COMPOUND`.
1. **Perception cheap wins** (`stories/15-perception-and-influence.md`
   § Near-term cheap wins) — threat-direction cover scoring, ranged LoS
   variant, threat-set gate on `HAS_LOS_TO_TARGET`. Lay the data-flow
   seam for the full perception system without committing to it.
2. **Slice 4 (Stories C + F)** — per-member assignment + bounding
   overwatch + objective rush under fire. F may collapse into J (the
   cordon goal hierarchy already covers planter-under-fire). See
   `stories/10-tactical-stories.md` § Slice 4.
3. **Slice 5 (Story H)** — last-stand `HoldPosition` on `MUST_HOLD`
   tactical nodes. Small scope.
4. **Story E (mech-screened advance)** — remaining piece of Slice 6.
   Blocked on mech GOAP Stage 2 work (`stories/13-mech-goap.md`).

## Parked but design-complete

- **Full perception & influence** (`stories/15-perception-and-influence.md`)
  — squad belief map + commander heatmap. Queues after cheap wins land.
- **Commander improvements** (`stories/12-squad-of-squads.md` §
  Improvement path) — contour-aware target picking, cross-strip
  reallocation, defender-side commanders. All gated on doc 15.
- **Mech GOAP Stage 2** (`stories/13-mech-goap.md`) — Recon + Assault
  roles, dynamic re-assignment from commander tier.
