## State of play

- **Primitives promoted:** hp/maxHp, cellX/cellY, cooldownTimer,
  moveProgress, renderX/renderY, attackDamage, attackRange, accuracy,
  secondaryCooldownTimer, secondaryActionTimer, secondaryAimTargetId,
  burstRemaining, burstTimer, burstTargetId, targetId, repositionCooldown,
  fallbackTimer, fallbackCellX/fallbackCellY, wanderDwellTimer.
  Three `long[]` (`secondaryAimTargetId`, `burstTargetId`, `targetId`).
- **Five consumers** on dense-iter + SoA array reads. (The burst pass in
  `InfantryWeapons.tick`, `targetId`'s ~17 sites, and the fall-back group's
  break-contact consumers route through accessors, not dense-iter yet.)
- **Full suite green** at `9104c85`. The prior `RecaptureTargetRegistryTest`
  / `BspMapPreviewTest` failures were sibling-session WIP and are no longer
  failing — never in any ECS-migration changeset.

## Active stories (priority order)

Phase 3's original three (move-render, tactical, secondary-weapon) all
shipped — see [`complete/phase3-soa-promotions.md`](complete/phase3-soa-promotions.md).
The next batch was scoped 2026-05-28 after auditing the leftover `Unit`
primitives and the (now thin) `BattleSimulation` orchestrator:

1. ~~[`burst-fire-primitives`](complete/burst-fire-primitives.md)~~ —
   **SHIPPED** (`024344f`). `burstRemaining`/`burstTimer`/`burstTargetId`
   → int/float/long[]. The MapTurret shadowing question resolved clean
   (turret keeps its own fields). Next promotion candidate ↓.
2. ~~[`target-id-primitive`](complete/target-id-primitive.md)~~ —
   **SHIPPED** (`7ae84e6`). `targetId` → `long[]`, the keystone
   cross-reference. ~17 consumer sites migrated (mechanical sweep fanned
   out to a Sonnet subagent). Next promotion candidate ↓.
3. ~~[`ai-timer-primitives`](complete/ai-timer-primitives.md)~~ —
   **SHIPPED** in two slices: Slice A `b620e77` (`repositionCooldown`),
   Slice B `9104c85` (`fallbackTimer` + `fallbackCellX/Y` + the optional
   `wanderDwellTimer` ride-along). The whole AI countdown/cache cluster is
   now off the POJO. With this done, no per-unit primitive worth a hot-loop
   win remains except the deferred low-payoff set below.
4. [`path-mutation-to-navigation`](stories/path-mutation-to-navigation.md) —
   **Service** cleanup: move `setPath`/`clearPath` bodies off the sim
   into NavigationService (which already owns the occupancy/destIndex
   state). Thin sim delegates stay, so consumer churn is ~zero. **Next up.**
5. [`drop-sim-facade-delegators`](stories/drop-sim-facade-delegators.md) —
   **Terminal** migration story: remove the ~40 `*SimContext`-style facade
   delegators (mutating behavior delegates + service getters) so consumers
   depend on services directly, not through the sim. The thin delegates
   kept across every prior SoA story were a deliberate zero-churn stepping
   stone; this is the destination. Large, multi-slice; churns the GOAP
   `Action`/`Goal` `sim`-param contract (~141-file reference surface), so
   it wants a quiet base — do it after path-mutation + the deferred SoA
   tail. Decide the consumer-injection mechanism (narrowing interface vs.
   services bundle) in the story before writing code.

Lower-priority / deferred: `attackCooldown` + `visionRange` + `moveSpeed`
(write-once stat-block completion — tidiness, not a hot-loop win);
`squadId` + `role` (read-mostly *branching* identity, not arithmetic
kernels — high churn, low SoA payoff; `role` is an enum needing an
ordinal int[]). Name them but don't lead with them.

## Sanity check before resuming

- `gradlew.bat compileJava` should be clean.
- All tests pass.
- `git log --oneline -5` should show `01fe905` or your own recent work
  at the top.
