# Next session — picking up the migration

Read [`overview.md`](overview.md) first for design rules.
Shipped work is in [`complete/`](complete/).

## State of play

- **Primitives promoted:** hp/maxHp, cellX/cellY, cooldownTimer,
  moveProgress, renderX/renderY, attackDamage, attackRange, accuracy,
  secondaryCooldownTimer, secondaryActionTimer, secondaryAimTargetId,
  burstRemaining, burstTimer, burstTargetId. Two `long[]` so far
  (`secondaryAimTargetId`, then `burstTargetId`).
- **Five consumers** on dense-iter + SoA array reads. (The burst pass in
  `InfantryWeapons.tick` routes through accessors, not dense-iter yet.)
- **Build green; all tests pass.**

## Active stories (priority order)

Phase 3's original three (move-render, tactical, secondary-weapon) all
shipped — see [`complete/phase3-soa-promotions.md`](complete/phase3-soa-promotions.md).
The next batch was scoped 2026-05-28 after auditing the leftover `Unit`
primitives and the (now thin) `BattleSimulation` orchestrator:

1. ~~[`burst-fire-primitives`](complete/burst-fire-primitives.md)~~ —
   **SHIPPED** (`024344f`). `burstRemaining`/`burstTimer`/`burstTargetId`
   → int/float/long[]. The MapTurret shadowing question resolved clean
   (turret keeps its own fields). Next promotion candidate ↓.
2. [`target-id-primitive`](stories/target-id-primitive.md) — `targetId`
   → `long[]`. Keystone: hottest per-unit cross-reference, read every
   tick; sets up deref-free dense target resolution.
3. [`ai-timer-primitives`](stories/ai-timer-primitives.md) —
   `repositionCooldown` (rides `tickCooldowns`, nearly free) + fallback
   group (`fallbackTimer` + `fallbackCellX/Y`). Sliceable.
4. [`path-mutation-to-navigation`](stories/path-mutation-to-navigation.md) —
   **Service** cleanup: move `setPath`/`clearPath` bodies off the sim
   into NavigationService (which already owns the occupancy/destIndex
   state). Thin sim delegates stay, so consumer churn is ~zero.

Lower-priority / deferred: `attackCooldown` + `visionRange` + `moveSpeed`
(write-once stat-block completion — tidiness, not a hot-loop win);
`squadId` + `role` (read-mostly *branching* identity, not arithmetic
kernels — high churn, low SoA payoff; `role` is an enum needing an
ordinal int[]). Name them but don't lead with them.

## Sanity check before resuming

- `gradlew.bat compileJava` should be clean.
- All tests pass.
- `git log --oneline -5` should show `01fe905` or your own recent work
  at the top.
