# Project: Starsector Marines

A Starsector mod (game version 0.98a-RC8). Source-of-truth game install is at
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Fractal Softworks\Starsector` — read-only reference, never edit.

For project vision, current focus, and immediate next-up, see
[`roadmap/`](roadmap/). Read `roadmap/README.md` first; each feature
directory has its own design doc and `next-session.md` for handoff state.

## Session worktrees (default workflow)

Keep the main workspace checked out on `main` and free of session edits so it
remains available as the integration point for concurrent sessions. For every
task that may change repository files, use this workflow unless the user
explicitly asks for a different one. Read-only investigation does not require a
worktree.

1. At the start of the task, inspect `git status` and `git worktree list`. If the
   session is already in a linked worktree under `.claude/worktrees/`, use it;
   do not create a nested worktree.
2. Otherwise, from the main workspace, create a uniquely named branch and
   linked worktree based on the current local `main`:

   ```powershell
   git worktree add -b session/<unique-name> .claude/worktrees/<unique-name> main
   ```

3. Change the session's working directory to that worktree. Perform all edits,
   builds, tests, staging, and commits there. Never make task changes directly
   in the main workspace.
4. Stage only paths owned by the session and commit all intended changes on the
   session branch. Do not use `git stash`, and do not modify, remove, or reuse
   another session's branch or worktree.
5. Before integration, merge the latest local `main` into the session branch
   inside the worktree and resolve conflicts there. Re-run relevant verification.
6. Return to the main workspace, verify that it is still on `main` and clean,
   then integrate with a fast-forward-only merge:

   ```powershell
   git merge --ff-only session/<unique-name>
   ```

   If `main` advanced and the fast-forward fails, go back to the session
   worktree, merge `main` again, verify, and retry. If the main workspace has
   uncommitted changes, do not absorb, discard, or overwrite them; leave the
   worktree intact and report the integration blocker.
7. Only after confirming that the session commit is reachable from `main`,
   remove the linked worktree and delete its merged branch from the main
   workspace:

   ```powershell
   git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/<unique-name>
   git branch -d session/<unique-name>
   ```

The main workspace is for brief integration and worktree administration only.
Do not run builds or leave generated task files there.

## Build & deploy

- Toolchain: Eclipse Adoptium JDK 25 (registered via Gradle's auto-detected toolchain).
- Bytecode target: Java 17 (`--release 17`). The game ships Zulu 17.0.10 + `--enable-preview`,
  so do NOT use language features newer than Java 17, and do NOT rely on preview features
  at compile time.
- `gradlew.bat build` → `mod/jars/StarsectorMarines.jar` (directly into the mod folder; no
  intermediate copy step).
- `gradlew.bat deployMod` → syncs `mod/` into `<starsectorDir>/mods/StarsectorMarines/`.
- `gradlew.bat runStarsector` → deploys then launches via `starsector-core/starsector.bat`.

## Mod layout

The `mod/` folder in this repo is what ships. `mod_info.json` lists the jar at
`jars/StarsectorMarines.jar`. The `modPlugin` entry point is
`com.dillon.starsectormarines.StarsectorMarinesModPlugin`.

## Starsector API conventions

- Compile-only deps (never bundle into the jar): `starfarer.api.jar`, `starfarer_obf.jar`,
  `lwjgl.jar`, `lwjgl_util.jar`, `json.jar`, `log4j-1.2.9.jar`, `xstream-1.4.10.jar`,
  `fs.common_obf.jar` — all live in `<starsectorDir>/starsector-core/`.
- API sources are in `<starsectorDir>/starsector-core/starfarer.api.zip` — unzip locally
  for IDE attachment, do not check in.
- Logging: `Global.getLogger(Class)` returns a log4j 1.2 `Logger`. Game logs to
  `<starsectorDir>/starsector-core/starsector.log`.
- The `BaseModPlugin` lifecycle: `onApplicationLoad` (once at game start, before any save),
  `onNewGame`/`onNewGameAfterEconomyLoad`/`onNewGameAfterTimePass`, `onGameLoad(newGame)`
  (every load), `beforeGameSave`/`afterGameSave`.
- Faction definitions: `mod/data/world/factions/<id>.faction` (JSON despite the extension).
- Hulls/variants: `mod/data/hulls/`, `mod/data/variants/` mirroring vanilla.
- Strings (for i18n): `mod/data/strings/strings.json`.

## Doc-driven development

Feature directories under `roadmap/` follow this layout:

```
roadmap/<feature>/
  overview.md        — concept, scope, cross-refs to related systems
  stories/           — active story/slice docs (one per story)
  complete/          — shipped stories move here (commit hash, what landed)
  next-session.md    — handoff state for picking up cold
  *.md               — other feature-specific docs (options analysis, etc.)
```

- Before implementing a feature, ensure `overview.md` exists with the concept
  and decomposition into stories.
- As stories ship, move them from `stories/` to `complete/` with
  shipped-with-details (commit hash, what actually landed vs. planned).
- **Update docs at commit boundaries.** When committing a story or slice,
  update `next-session.md` (state of play, commit chain, strike-through
  shipped stories) and log shipped work in `complete/` in the same commit
  or immediately after. Don't accumulate doc debt across multiple commits.
- Keep `roadmap/README.md` current focus and immediate next-up sections honest —
  if priorities shifted, say so.
- Existing feature dirs are migrated incrementally as they're touched.

## Conventions for this repo

- Package root: `com.dillon.starsectormarines`.
- Mod ID: `starsector_marines` (snake_case is the Starsector convention).
- Version in `mod_info.json` and `build.gradle` should match.
- Do not edit anything under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Fractal Softworks\Starsector` — it's
  read-only reference. Vanilla files there are the canonical examples for data schemas.

## Code style

- **NEVER write an inline fully-qualified name. Use `import` + simple name —
  always, in every line you write or edit.** (`Vehicle v`, not
  `com.dillon.starsectormarines.battle.vehicle.Vehicle v`.) The ONLY exception
  is a Javadoc `{@link}`, where an FQN is fine and needs no import. This is
  unconditional for new/edited code: **do not "follow context clues."** If the
  file you're editing is full of inline FQNs, you still add an import and use the
  simple name for your additions — match the project style, never the file's bad
  habit. (Two carve-outs that are about *not touching other code*, not about
  writing FQN: don't do sweeping FQN→import refactors of existing files unasked,
  and a mechanical package-move rewrite that merely preserves a file's existing
  FQNs is fine.)

## Committing

Linked worktrees give each session its own working tree and index, but commits
should still stay narrowly scoped:

1. Stage explicit paths only — `git add <path> …`, never `git add -A`/`.`.
2. Review `git status` and the staged diff before committing.
3. Commit only the current task's files. Leave unrelated files and other
   sessions' work alone.
4. Never `git stash`; it complicates ownership and recovery across worktrees.

### Commit-command mechanics (these have bitten before)

- **`-m` goes BEFORE `--`.** `git commit -m "msg" -- <path> …`. Anything after
  `--` is a pathspec, so `git commit -- <path> -m "msg"` makes git treat `-m`
  and the message as filenames (`pathspec '-m' did not match any file(s)`).
- **Match the shell to the tool.** The here-string for multi-line messages
  (`-m @'…'@`) is **PowerShell only** — use it in the PowerShell tool. The
  **Bash** tool reads `@'…'@` literally and mangles the commit. In the Bash
  tool, pass the message as a normal double-quoted string (`-m "line1
  line2"`); avoid backticks and `$` in it, or single-quote. Pick one tool per
  commit and quote for that shell.
- A failed-pathspec error means **nothing was committed** — fix the flag order
  / quoting and re-run (the `git add` already staged the files; don't re-add).

## Workspace location

Sessions normally start in the main workspace at
`C:/Users/Dillon/IdeaProjects/starsectormarines`. Read-only tasks may remain
there. For tasks that change files, follow the session worktree workflow above
and run all task commands from `C:/Users/Dillon/IdeaProjects/starsectormarines/.claude/worktrees/<unique-name>`.

## Multi-project layout

- `:` (root) — the mod itself. `src/main/java` holds `StarsectorMarinesModPlugin`, the
  bridge intel plugin, the scene-graph renderer.
- `:asset-pipeline` — vendored copy of MoonLight Engine's asset code. Two source sets:
    - `main` (runtime) — MeshData, LoadedModel, MaterialInfo, Animation, Skeleton, Bone,
      BvhParser, AnimationRetargeter, ModelSerializer. **Bundled into the mod jar via
      fat-jar.** Depends only on JOML at runtime. No Lombok, no Log4j 2, no LWJGL 3.
    - `tool` (build-time importer) — ModelLoader, MeshExtractor, MaterialExtractor,
      AnimationExtractor, BoneRemapConfig, ProcessModelsTask, ConventionNormalizer,
      AssetConventionConfig. Uses Assimp + LWJGL 3 + Log4j 2. **Never ships.**
      Invoke via `gradlew :asset-pipeline:processModels`.
- The mod's `jar` task pulls in `:asset-pipeline:main` outputs + JOML via the
  runtime classpath, producing a single fat jar at `mod/jars/StarsectorMarines.jar`.
